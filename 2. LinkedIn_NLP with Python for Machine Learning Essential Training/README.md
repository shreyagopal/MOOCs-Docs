# NLP with Python for Machine Learning Essential Training (LinkedIn Learning)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Natural language processing is a field concerned with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language.*

**Overview:** <br>

With the increased amount of data publicly available and the increased focus on unstructured text data, understanding how to clean, process, and analyze that text data is 
tremendously valuable. If you have some experience with Python and an interest in natural language processing (NLP), this course can provide you with the knowledge you need 
to tackle complex problems using machine learning. This course was designed to provide a quick summary of basic natural language processing (NLP) concepts, covers advanced 
data cleaning and vectorization techniques, and then takes a deep dive into building machine learning classifiers. The last step of this course shows how to build two 
different types of machine learning models, as well as how to evaluate and test variations of those models.

**Learning objectives:**
* Explain the definition of an NLP.
* Describe the process of tokenizing.
* Identify the purpose of vectorizing.
* Recognize the outcomes of lemmatizing.
* Summarize the characteristics of TF-IDF.
* Define accuracy in terms of evaluation metrics.
* Recall three benefits of using ensemble methods.
